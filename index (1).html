<p class="p1"><b>Terms of Use</b></p>
<p class="p2">Justas Birgiolas ("I" or "Me" or "My") provides relaxation mobile device application ("App") called CenteredState. I also provide a website ("Site") located at CenteredState.com. Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully because they govern your use of the App.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Agreement to Terms</b></span><br>
By using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Changes to Terms or App</b></span><br>
I may modify the Terms at any time, in my sole discretion. If I do so, I'll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It's important that you review the Terms whenever I modify them because if you continue to use the App after I have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you can't use the App anymore. Because my App is evolving over time I may change or discontinue all or any part of the App, at any time and without notice, at my sole discretion.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Who May Use the App</b></span><br>
You may use the App only if you are 13 years or older and are not barred from using the App under applicable law. To make a purchase via the App (described in the Section titled "Purchases" below), you must be 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Using the App</b></span><br>
Via the App, users can select from a variety of options to create customized relaxation, breathing, and stretching sessions. Users of the App can also use the paid functionality of the App to utilize the enhanced functionality of the App, described in further detail under the Section titled "Purchases" below.</p>
<p class="p3">You understand and agree that the App and any other information you learn from Me are not intended, designed, or implied to diagnose, prevent,&nbsp;or treat any condition or disease, to ascertain the state of your health, or to be a substitute for professional medical care. &nbsp;Not all activities described on the App are suitable for everyone. Consult a physician before using the App. If you experience any pain, discomfort, or any other harm while using the App, stop using the App immediately. Do not use the App while driving, operating heavy machinery, or performing other tasks that require attention and concentration. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of the App.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Purchases</b></span><br>
I offer certain enhanced functionality of the App in exchange for the payment of one-time fees. Descriptions of features associated with those offerings are available via the App. If you choose to purchase the enhanced offerings via the App, you agree to pay the applicable fee and any taxes, and the fee will be charged to your account with the app store or distribution platform (like the Apple App Store or Google Play) where the App is made available (each, an "<span class="s1"><b>App Provider</b></span>"). All fees are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Feedback</b></span><br>
I welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the App ("<span class="s1"><b>Feedback</b></span>").

<p class="p4"><b>Dispute Resolution</b></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Governing Law</span><br>
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Agreement to Arbitrate</span> You and I agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the App or Content (collectively, "<span class="s1"><b>Disputes</b></span>") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an "<span class="s1"><b>IP Protection Action</b></span>"). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Western District of Pennsylvania and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. <span class="s1"><b>You acknowledge and agree that you and I are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding</b></span>. Further, unless both you and Me otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Arbitration Rules</span><br>
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("<span class="s1"><b>AAA</b></span>") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "<span class="s1"><b>AAA Rules</b></span>") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med"><span class="s2">www.adr.org/arb_med</span></a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Arbitration Process</span><br>
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175"><span class="s2">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</span></a>) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Arbitration Location and Procedure</span><br>
Unless you and I otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and I submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Arbitrator's Decision</span><br>
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. I will not seek, and hereby waive all rights I may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if I prevail in arbitration.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Fees</span><br>
your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, I will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Changes</span><br>
Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if I change this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by completing an online form at http://goo.gl/nb7yQ) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of My email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Me in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>General Terms</b></span><br>
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Me and you regarding the App and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Me and you regarding the App and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p class="p3">You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without My prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. I may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<p class="p3">Any notices or other communications provided by Me under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) by Me via email; or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
<p class="p3">My failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by My duly authorized representative. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
