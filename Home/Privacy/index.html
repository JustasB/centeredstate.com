<p class="p1"><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p class="p2">Protecting your privacy is really important to me. Accordingly, I am providing this Privacy Policy to explain my practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that I receive when you use my Services (as defined in my Terms of Service, accessible at <a href="http://www.centeredstate.com/Home/Terms">http://www.CenteredState.com/Home/Terms</a>. This Privacy Policy applies only to those websites, services and applications included within "Services" and doesn't apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through my Services. Also, please note that, unless I define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in my Terms of Service.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>How do I collect and use information?</b></p>
<p class="p2">My primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve my Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate my Services.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Account Information</span>. If you choose to opt in to receive email notifications and newsletters from me or if you choose to invite a friend to use the Services, I'll collect certain information that can be used to identify you or your friend, such as name and email address ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII").</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Collected Using Cookies</span>. I collect certain information through the use of "cookies," which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access my Services. I may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you've logged in to the Services and to tell me how and when you interact with my Services. I may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on my Services and to customize and improve my Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don't accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that I engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only my use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Related to Use of the Services</span>. my servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses my Services (I refer to this information as "Log Data"), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a "User"). Log Data may include information such as a User's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing my Services, the pages or features of my Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on my Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. I use this information to administer the Services and I analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to my Users' needs and preferences. I may use a person's IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. I also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how my Services are used.</p>
<p class="p2">I use Google Analytics and Flurry Analytics to collect, monitor and analyze Log Data in order to increase my Services' functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor my Services to my visitors' needs. I also use this information to verify that visitors to the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests. Accordingly, Log Data is shared with Google and Flurry, which have their own privacy policies (accessible at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a> and <a href="http://www.flurry.com/about-us/legal/privacy.html">http://www.flurry.com/about-us/legal/privacy.html</a> respectively) addressing how these parties use such information. You may opt out of Flurry Analytics tracking and personalized ads/recommendations from Flurry by clicking <a href="http://www.flurry.com/resources/privacy.html">here</a>. Please note that the opt-out is specific to Flurry activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Location Information</span>. In some cases I collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. I may use location information to improve and personalize my Services for you.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Inviting Friends to use the Services</span>. If you choose to invite a friend to use the Services, I will ask you for your name and email address, and your friend's name and email address. I will use this information to automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to join the Services. I store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of my invite-a-friend program. If your friend would like me to delete his or her information, he or she can contact me at <a href="http://goo.gl/nb7yQ"><span class="s2">http://goo.gl/nb7yQ</span></a><span class="s2"> </span>with a deletion request.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What Information Do I Share With Third Parties?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I will not share any PII that I have collected from you except as described below:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Shared with my Services Providers</span>. I may engage third party service providers to work with me to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on my behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Shared with Third Parties</span>. I may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</span>. Information that I collect from my users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if I go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if I are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Disclosed for my Protection and the Protection of Others</span>. It is my policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that I believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it is also my policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties. Accordingly, I reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as I, in my sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect my property, rights and safety and the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iv) to prevent or stop activity I consider to be illegal or unethical.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><b>The Security of Your Information</b></span><br>
I take reasonable measures to protect the information that I collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, I cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><b>Links to Other Sites</b></span><br>
My Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. my Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and I am not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information I recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><b>Modifying and Deleting Your Information</b></span><br>
You can modify or request that I delete any PII you provide via the Services by contacting me at <a href="http://goo.gl/nb7yQ"><span class="s2">http://goo.gl/nb7yQ</span></a><span class="s2">.</span> I'll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for my records or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><b>International Transfer</b></span><br>
Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you're located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to me, I may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><b>My Policy Toward Children</b></span><br>
My Services are not directed to children under 13 and I do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If I learn that I have collected PII of a child under 13 I will take steps to delete such information from my files as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><b>Changes to Privacy Policy</b></span><br>
Any information that I collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected. I may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If I make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, I'll notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and I'll indicate when such changes will become effective.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><b>Questions?</b></span><br>
Please contact me at <a href="http://goo.gl/nb7yQ"><span class="s2">http://goo.gl/nb7yQ</span></a> if you have any questions about my Privacy Policy.</p>
